# Life-Expectancy-with-R

This repository contains data and analysis on the relationship between life expectancy, fertility rate, and happiness score for a sample of countries.

Data
The LifeExpectancy dataset includes data for over 200 countries and includes the following variables:

Country: name of the country
LifeMen: life expectancy for men
LifeWomen: life expectancy for women
HappinessScore: happiness score for the country
FertilityRate: fertility rate for the country
Analysis
The analysis conducted on the LifeExpectancy dataset focused on exploring the relationships between life expectancy, fertility rate, and happiness score for men and women.

Scatter plots and linear regression were used to visualize the relationships between these variables. The results of the analysis suggest that there is a positive relationship between life expectancy and happiness score, as well as a positive relationship between fertility rate and happiness score, for both men and women. However, the strength of these relationships appears to differ between men and women, with the relationship between life expectancy and happiness score appearing to be stronger for women, and the relationship between fertility rate and happiness score appearing to be stronger for men.

Additionally, a boxplot was used to compare the happiness scores of men and women. The results of this analysis suggest that there is no significant difference between the happiness scores of men and women.

Conclusion
Overall, the analysis conducted on the LifeExpectancy dataset suggests that both life expectancy and fertility rate may be important factors in determining happiness score. However, the relative importance of these factors appears to differ between men and women. Further analysis and interpretation of these results could potentially provide more insight into the underlying relationships between these variables.


Here are data visualizations that depict the various relationships via scatter plots:
